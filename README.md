# Pop Art 101

An interative educational app that covers key artists of the Pop Art Movement.

The app was made using Vue JS, Express, and Mongo DB, with custom-built API.

The app offers a concise timeline of the transatlantic Pop Art movement, several pages dedicated to the most influential figures associated with it, an interative pop quiz, and a favourites page. The user can interact with the images displayed on the pages and add/remove them to favourites.

This app was developed as part of the group project in CodeClan.
